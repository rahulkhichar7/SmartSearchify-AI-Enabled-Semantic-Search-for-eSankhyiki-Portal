Persons who, owing to lack of work, had not worked but either sought work through employment exchanges, intermediaries, friends or relatives or by making applications to prospective employers or expressed their willingness or availability for work under the prevailing conditions of work and remuneration, were considered as those ‘seeking or available for work’ (or unemployed). The number of persons unemployed for a relatively long period during a reference period of 365 days is defined as unemployed in the usual principal status or in usual status (ps). However, some of the unemployed on the basis of this criterion might be working in a subsidiary capacity.
